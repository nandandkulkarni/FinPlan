Add Category: creates a new category and initial item. Use category header actions to add more items.
Tab actions: edit a tab header, delete a tab, or create ghost tabs (quick-create suggested plan names).
Add Item (per category): creates a new item and opens the edit modal so you can fill details immediately.
Collapse / Expand All: toggle category visibility to focus.

[PAUSE 400ms]
Item row fields (spoken while showing a row) (30–40s)

Item: subcategory name.
Frequency: Monthly / Quarterly / Yearly — the calculator converts to a per-month equivalent.
Per Unit / Per Month: shows the item’s current value and monthly equivalent.
Retirement Adjustment: one of Same, Custom %, Manual, Adjust for Inflation. This determines how the retirement value is computed.
Inflation column: shows per-item inflation source and custom percent if used.
Included?: checkbox if this item counts toward retirement totals.
Retirement Value: calculated monthly retirement cost for the item.
View/Edit button: opens the details modal to edit all of these settings.
[PAUSE 300ms]
Details modal — how to use it (30–45s)

Opens in edit mode for the selected item. You can: rename the subcategory, change frequency, edit current value, pick a retirement adjustment, set custom percent or a manual retirement value, and pick per-item inflation source (global or custom).
Include in Retirement toggles whether this item contributes to the retirement total.
Save applies changes and triggers an autosave; Cancel closes without saving. Use the Edit button if the modal opens in read-only mode.
[PAUSE 400ms]
Autosave, undo, and saving details (25–35s)

Edits auto-save after a short debounce (about 800ms) to avoid interrupting flow. A thin saving indicator appears while saving.
Removed items show a short “Item removed” toast with Undo for 5 seconds. If you don’t undo, the removal is finalized and saved.
Tab header save: editing a tab’s header shows Save and Cancel next to the tab; saving updates the stored header in the backend.
There are Delete Tab and Delete All actions; both prompt for confirmation. Deleting All removes all saved dynamic plans for the current user.

Examples — two quick walkthroughs (each ~25–30s)

Example A: Create a city plan
Click Add Plan, then select the new tab.
Set Years to Retirement to 10, Inflation to 3.0.
Add a “Housing” category, add a “Rent” item, set Frequency to Monthly and Current Value to your monthly rent, set Adjust to Adjust for Inflation. Watch Retirement Total update.
Example B: Manual override for a known future cost
Add an item for “Mortgage paid off in retirement.”
In the item modal choose Retirement Adjustment = Manual, and enter the monthly retirement value you expect. Save and confirm totals update.

Tips and common pitfalls (20–30s)

Use categories to group recurring items like Housing, Transportation, Healthcare — totals are grouped and clear.
Choose Adjust for Inflation to rely on the global inflation rate or set per-item custom inflation when needed.
If a saved plan doesn’t appear, check the small timeout modal — it can retry loading.
Rename tabs to meaningful city or scenario names so comparisons are obvious.
Be mindful that frequency is converted to monthly; enter values in the selected frequency’s units.
[PAUSE 300ms]
Accessibility & keyboard shortcuts (20–30s)

Navigate tabs with Arrow Left and Arrow Right; press Enter or Space to activate.
While editing a tab header press Enter to save or Escape to cancel.
Numeric fields trigger autosave on Enter or blur.
Buttons include titles and aria attributes for screen readers; modals use standard focus patterns. Speak UI labels while demonstrating.
[PAUSE 300ms]
Narration pacing suggestions (for recording)

Intro lines: steady, clear, 1.2–1.4x normal speed with short 500ms pauses between major segments.
When walking through examples: slow slightly, pause 600–800ms between steps.
When describing controls: speak evenly, allow 300–400ms between sentences to let listeners absorb details.
End each section with a short 800ms pause to signal transition.

Closing sentence (10s)

That’s the overview and guided walkthrough. Use the Add Plan and Add Category flows to build scenarios, rely on autosave, and edit items via the View/Edit modal to fine-tune retirement assumptions.
If you want, I can convert this into separate short audio-ready scripts (Overview, Controls, Walkthrough, Examples, Tips) with exact line breaks and timing markers. Which would you prefer?
