    FinPlan is a lightweight set of personal finance tools and calculators designed to help you plan and visualise your
    finances. The site provides calculators for cost-of-living, retirement planning, savings growth and other budgeting helpers.

<p>
    Who we are: a small team focused on building practical, easy-to-use calculators and clear explanations so you can make
    better financial decisions. This site is for educational purposes and to help you explore scenarios — it is not a replacement
    for professional financial advice.
