## üé¨ Script

### [0:00-0:20] Opening & Welcome

"Welcome to ReWealthen - your comprehensive financial projection system designed to help you plan for a secure retirement. Whether you're just starting your wealth-building journey or fine-tuning your retirement strategy, ReWealthen provides the tools you need to visualize your financial future with clarity and confidence."

### [0:20-0:50] The Three-Step System Overview

"ReWealthen uses a simple three-step planning process:

**Step 1** - The Future Cost of Living Planner helps you estimate your expenses in retirement, accounting for inflation over time.

**Step 2** - The Savings & Wealth Building Planner shows how your current savings and investments will grow until retirement.

**Step 3** - The Retirement Income Planner projects whether your savings can sustain you throughout retirement, considering Social Security, pensions, and other income sources."

---

### [0:50-1:30] Step 1: Future Cost of Living

"Let's start with Step 1: Future Cost of Living. This planner helps you understand what your current expenses might look like in the future. You'll enter your monthly expenses across categories like housing, food, transportation, healthcare, and entertainment. The system automatically applies inflation rates to project these costs into the future - showing you what you'll actually need to maintain your lifestyle in retirement. You can set different inflation rates for each category, because healthcare typically increases faster than groceries, for example."

---

### [1:30-2:10] Step 2: Savings & Wealth Building

"Next, the Savings & Wealth Building Planner takes your current financial situation and projects it forward. Enter your existing savings accounts - 401(k)s, IRAs, brokerage accounts, savings accounts - along with your current contributions. The system shows you a year-by-year projection of how your wealth will grow based on different return rates. You'll see exactly how much you could accumulate by retirement age. This planner also lets you model different scenarios: What if you increase your contributions by 5%? What if the market returns are lower than expected?"

---

### [2:10-2:40] Step 3: Retirement Income

"Finally, the Retirement Income Planner brings it all together. This is where you see if your accumulated savings from Step 2 can cover your projected expenses from Step 1 throughout your retirement years. The system accounts for Social Security benefits, pension income, and safe withdrawal rates from your savings. You'll see year-by-year whether you're on track or if adjustments are needed. The key insight? If the numbers don't work, you can go back to Step 1 and adjust your projected retirement lifestyle, or return to Step 2 and increase your savings rate."

---

### [2:40-3:00] Closing & Call to Action

"ReWealthen is designed to be iterative - you'll likely go through the three steps multiple times, adjusting and optimizing until you find a plan that works for you. Each page includes a quick feedback survey on the right side - please take a moment to share your thoughts so we can continue improving the system. Ready to take control of your financial future? Let's get started with Step 1: Future Cost of Living. Welcome to ReWealthen!"
